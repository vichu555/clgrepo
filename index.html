      <h3 style="color: maroon">SPORTS</h3>

          <p>Participation in games and sports invariably ensures good health, fitness and, generally, 
            freedom from ailments of various types. Physical fitness is essential for 
            proficiency in studies and for winning distinctions in examinations.
             Ailing bodies do not make for sharp brains. Exercise in some form or another is necessary, 
             and sports provide an easy method to ensure such fitness. Playing the game on the playground
              naturally instructs people to play the game of life in the right spirit,
               which is what matters most, not victory or defeat.
</p>
        <p>The College provides facilities for the following games and sports:</p> 
<ol>
      <li>Cricket.</li>  
      <li>Football.</li>  
      <li>Volleyball.</li>  
      <li>Kabbadi.</li>  
      <li>Tinnes.</li>  
      <li>Badminton.</li>  
      <li>Chess.</li>  
      <li>Athletics.</li>  
</ol>
         <p> All the students of the College are members of the Athletic Association. The Physical Director is the Ex-officio secretary of the association. The activities of the association shall be managed by a sports Committee.
        </p>
        <p>Intramural sports and tournaments are conducted every year. Players and Athletes selected for college teams should play for the college only.
        </p>
<h3 style="color: maroon">NATIONAL SERVICE SCHEME</h3>

         <p>The Motto of NSS, "NOT ME BUT YOU", reflects the essence of democratic living and upholds the need for self-less service. NSS helps the students develop appreciation to other person's point of view and also show consideration to other fellow human beings.
        </p> 
        <p>The College has 2 units, with strength of 200 volunteers. Every student member of NSS should serve for at least two years with 120 hours of engagement in community service, per year, excluding annual camps. At the end of two years of satisfactory service, every student member 
          will receive the NSS Certificate, which is considered as equivalent to a diploma in Social Service.
        </p> 
        <p> The main objectives of National Service Scheme (NSS) are :</p>
<ul>
      <li> Understand the community in which they work.</li> 
      <li> Understand themselves in relation to their community.</li> 
      <li> Identify the needs and problems of the community and involve them in problem solving.</li> 
      <li> Develop among themselves a sense of social and civic responsibility.</li> 
      <li> Utilize their knowledge in finding practical solutions to individual and community problems.</li> 
      <li> Develop competence required for group-living and sharing of responsibilities.</li> 
      <li> Gain skills in mobilizing community participation.</li> 
      <li> Acquire leadership qualities and democratic attitudes.</li> 
      <li> Develop capacity to meet emergencies and natural disasters.</li> 
      <li> Practice national integration and social harmony.</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Youth Red Cross</h3>

         <p>Youth Red Cross is a youth wing of the Indian Red Cross Society functioning in our college. It has young volunteers who can make a significant contribution to meeting the needs of the most vulnerable people within their local communities. The programe focuses on the following areas:
        </p>

      </li> 
      <li>Encourage community service through training and education.</li> 
      <li> Promote international friendship with activities that cultivate a humanitarian spirit.</li> 
      <li> Provide technical support in the development of youth programes, fund-raising, identification of material and human resources.
</li> 
</ol>
<h3>Red Ribbon Club</h3>
<p>
          The Red Ribbon Club, functioning in our college, is a voluntary on-campus intervention programme for students. It is initiated and supported by the State AIDS Control Society and implemented through multi-sectoral collaboration, particularly, using the services of cadre officers of the State's National Service Scheme (NSS).
        </p>
      <p>The programe will address the knowledge, attitude and behavior of the youths in the interrelated areas of Voluntary Blood Donation, HIV & AIDS prevention, as demanded by their age, environment, and life style. The Red Ribbon Club will serve as a complementary and comprehensive prevention intervention to support and reinforce similar youth led initiatives. It will also prepare and promote youth peer educators within and outside the campuses.
